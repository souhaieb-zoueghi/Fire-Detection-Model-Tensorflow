## 1. Introduction
This is a simple image classification project developed using Tensorflow and Keras, I used a model that was created by machine learning experts and that has already been trained on a large dataset (mobilenet). To avoid overfitting I perfomed multiple random operations on the training images (zoom, horizontal_flip ...) so that the model never sees the exact same image twice.
